![PVSYSTEM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/323cde58-6b64-4750-814b-9e57bea028e4)

This repository showcases a comprehensive project on the design, simulation, and economic analysis of a stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) system that could serve a GUC dorm located in new cairo based on the average power consumption of 3 students. The project includes:

- **Project Report:** Detailed documentation of the system design, simulation results, and cost analysis.
- **Presentation:** Slides summarizing the project objectives, methodology, and key findings.
- **Simulation Report:** In-depth analysis of simulation data, performance metrics, and system validation.
  
*All the details and design decisions are found in the **project report.***
## Project Overview

The project focuses on:
- **System Design:** Site analysis, load estimation, and PV system configuration.
- **Simulation & Analysis:** Comparison of seasonal tilting versus two-axis tracking, and evaluation of system performance using PVSyst.
- **Economic Evaluation:** Cost breakdown, component analysis, and payback period estimation.
